# Project Details

## Getting Started

In the project directory:

### 1. App Settings

Make a file called `appsettings.json`

Copy the content out of the `appsettings.example.json` and fill in the needed information

### 2. Get `.NET` up

Download the latest `.NET` Core SDK
* [`.NET` Core 2.2 SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/README.md)

`.NET` Core Releases and Daily Builds
* [.NET Core released builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/README.md)
* [.NET Core daily builds](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/daily-builds.md)

`.NET` Commands

#### Restore
The dotnet restore command restores any packages or dependencies that the project requires. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore?tabs=netcore2x) for details on the command.

#### Build
The dotnet build command builds the project along with all of its dependencies. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build) for more details.

#### Run
This is the last command that needs to be performed. It executes the code so that the code starts running. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run?tabs=netcore30) for more information.

### Learn More About `.NET`

[Learn about .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core)

In order to run the code certain commands need to be executed. This can be done through the `.Net CLI`. This [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x) contains general information on the dotnet CLI commands, and this [link](https://dzone.com/articles/create-and-run-a-net-core-application-using-cli-to) explains the flows required to run a dotnet project from the CLI.
